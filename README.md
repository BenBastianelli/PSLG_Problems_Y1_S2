**WELCOME ! to this semesters PSLG problem solution Github**<br>
This file will serve as a guide on how to navigate the github and also might be some of your guys first intro to the powerful code sharing application that is github!<br>
<br>for those who are new the below intro heading will explain how to navigate this and all repositories!!<br>

## ðŸ’¿IntroðŸ’¿
**So, How do I navigate a repository?!?!?**<br>
Well with this github I will try to make it as stream lined as possible. <br>
On the homepage of this repository (A place where people can organise and store code for projects) you should hopefully see a folder with some arbitrary name like <br>
***"PSLG_Y2_S2"*** and if so thats great because it means I've done my job. <br>

<br>If you click through that folder you'll find another one called ***"src"*** Which is where I will store the solutions for the problems each week!<br>

<br> Each folder will be named as the relevant week to when the questions were posed so for example Week 1 will host the pascal triangle problem I did <br>

<br> You may be asking however, "How do I run this really cool code you made?" and first of all thank you you're too nice! Second of all you can do it in 1 of two ways which is going to be our next heading 

## ðŸ›œPulling from the repositoryðŸ›œ
Now, for anyone who doesn't want to go through the hassle of learning something new, you can just set-up a new project on your favourite IDE, Download the files using the download button on the top right of whatever file you've opened for whatever week and then open it up on said IDE and run it. But for those who want to learn how to pull from this git I'll explain that now. <br>

<br> As this is a public repository and I've set the permissions to allow everyone to have pull access this should be relatively easy to explain <br>

<br> First of all if you don't have git bash look up a tutorial to set it up and install it. <br>
<br> **Tutorial** : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdwWe9COT9k <br>

<br> Once you have that done set up a new directory / folder in your Favourite IDE and name it something memorable! <br>

<br> after that open up your terminal and navigate to that directory<br> (the command to change directories in the command prompt is : ***"cd path/to/your/directory"***)<br>

<br> once there type the following commands! <br>
  - git init
  - git remote add origin https://github.com/BenBastianelli/PSLG_Problems_Y1_S2.git
  - git remote -v \# makes sure the remote was correctly set up
  - git clone https://github.com/BenBastianelli/PSLG_Problems_Y1_S2.git  \# pulls everything from the current version of this repository into your local folder
  - \# If you've already cloned the repository and only want to get the new files type the code below
  - git pull origin main

<br> **And thats it !!** You can now say your one step closer to being a full fledged developer as pretty much everyone uses github to work on their projects <br>
